Welcome to the digital arena where titans clash, where silicon brains compute billions of moves per second, and where the result is... always the same.

This is a tribute to the beautiful, perfect, and utterly predictable game of Stockfish vs. Stockfish.

### The Epic Saga

*   **White:** "I have calculated 40 moves ahead and found the optimal path to victory."
*   **Black:** "Fascinating. I have also calculated 40 moves ahead and found the optimal path to ensure you don't."
*   **Result:** A digital handshake, a shared byte of data, and a perfect `0.5 - 0.5` score.

It's the chess equivalent of `while(true) { draw; }`.

So sit back, relax, and marvel at the sheer perfection of a game where the only winning move is... to be Stockfish.
